### What I learned
I found CSS to be the most difficult part. 
I learned a lot about positioning and using different techniques like grid/flex.

### Difficulties
I still find CSS to be quite unpredictable as it behaves differently than I expect in some cases.
I need to do some more studying to better understand certain CSS behaviour especially the sizing of nested divs is quite confusing at times.
